# An Investigation on the Life on Land: Applying Data Analytical Approaches on Wildlife Data

The world is shifting toward technological solutions by advancing human life in every aspect. However, these upgrades have shifted our focus from the importance of protecting life on land and the environment which is disrupting the balance of the ecosystem and biodiversity. In order to conserve wildlife and protect the ecosystem, it is necessary to discover the weak points or problems and provide proper solutions. This paper contributes to this aspect by analyzing datasets related to the extinction of wildlife and its connection with forest land by applying data analytics approaches. The purpose of this research is to extract information related to forest loss, threatened species, extinction of species, and more. Three datasets have been analyzed for that reason by applying descriptive and inferential statistics, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms, and the outcomes are discussed. After exploring the data it can be stated that there are similarities in the pattern of forest loss and the red list index which required attention in order to protect biodiversity. In addition, after applying the machine learning algorithms it has been found that the random forest regressor model suits best for this dataset to predict the red list index value, and in the case of deep learning, the LSTM and CNN both show similarities

## Results
The line plot illustrates the mean of Forest land vs the mean of agricultural land and depicts that through the years, both of them are decreasing.

To show the connection between the forest land and the red list index value a graph has been shown. As the two separate datasets do not contain the same yearly value, to provide connectivity, the value from 2001 to 2020 has been taken from both datasets by filtering the required value. The graph shows the mean values of each value throughout the mentioned years. Here a pattern is clearly visible as the amount of forest land is decreasing globally over the years, and so does the red list index. this can conclude that the loss of forest land is impacting the increase of wildlife extinction.

The following Figure shows the mean threatened value for all species where it can be seen that the invertebrates species has the least mean threatened value whereas still, the amphibians are at high risk.

The next graph shows the mean of total threatened species comparing the mean of total known species and categorized by the species. In this graph, only the mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians values have been shown. The plot gives an overview that the amphibians are at the most risk as the mean of threatened value is high compared to its known value
